<strong>90853 Book captured web pre-auth as a Payment line on the collect transaction; fix mixed Payment + Pre-Auth double booking</strong>
<ul><li>Collecting a web order that was paid in advance now creates a payment line on the POS transaction. The statement posts that payment, so the transaction balances and has transaction payment entries. Orders that mix a payment and a pre-authorization no longer book the pre-authorized amount twice.</li><li><b>Action required by partners:</b>
<ul>
<li>Check that the collecting POS uses a local request. Open the POS functionality profile of the terminal and go to <b>Web Requests &gt; CustomerOrderUpdateV5</b>. On the highest-priority row, set <b>Local Request</b> to <b>Yes</b> and leave <b>Dist. Location</b><b>blank</b>. Remote setups keep posting to the general ledger.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
