<strong>90853 Book captured web pre-auth as a Payment line on the collect transaction; fix mixed Payment + Pre-Auth double booking</strong>
<ul><li>Collecting a web order that was paid in advance now creates a payment line on the POS transaction. The statement posts that payment, so the transaction balances and has transaction payment entries. Orders that mix a payment and a pre-authorization no longer book the pre-authorized amount twice.</li><li><b>Action required by partners:</b>
<ul>
<li>Check that the collecting POS uses a local request. Open the POS functionality profile of the terminal and go to <b>Web Requests &gt; CustomerOrderUpdateV5</b>. On the highest-priority row, set <b>Local Request</b> to <b>Yes</b> and leave <b>Dist. Location</b> <b>blank</b>. Remote setups keep posting to the general ledger.</li>
</ul>

<strong>90812 Planned Stock Demand Overflow Error in Replen. Journal</strong>
<ul><li><b>Delete Processed Planned Stock Demand Entries</b>
<ul>
<li>Processed Planned Stock Demand entries can now be deleted, either automatically with a scheduler job (using codeunit "LSC Replen. Del. Pl.Stock Dem.") or manually with the <b>Replen. Delete Planned Stock Demand</b> report.</li>
<li>A new field, <b>Days to Keep Planned Stock Demand Lines</b>, is added to the Replen. Setup page. It specifies how many days processed Planned Stock Demand entries are kept. Processed entries with a process date older than this are deleted. The remaining entries are renumbered, resetting the Entry No. sequence and freeing up available integer values.</li>

<strong>90230 Reactivate Insert Job Queue Default Entries action on Kitchen Service Configuration</strong>
<ul><li>The <b>Insert Job Queue Default Entries</b> action on the Kitchen Service Configuration page works again. It creates the Web KDS job queue category and the <b>Update routing information for Kitchen Display Stations</b> job.

<strong>89827 Price List Line Unit Price not converted to line unit of measure when item card price changes (Sales UoM ≠ Base UoM)</strong>
<ul><li>Changing the unit price on an item card now updates only price list lines in the item’s base unit of measure, plus lines with no unit of measure set. Before, it could copy the base unit price into lines priced in the sales unit of measure.</li><li><b>Action required by partners:</b>
<ul>
<li>Review price list lines for items whose sales unit of measure differs from the base unit. Lines already overwritten by the old behavior are not corrected by this fix, so fix their prices manually.</li>

<ul><li>A tender coupon can now be used on an item scanned with a price in the barcode, when that price is lower than the item's standard price.</li></ul>
<strong>89432 OneListCalculate results in coupon reservation</strong>
<ul><li>Calculate a web basket with a serial-number coupon, and the coupon is now validated and priced without being reserved.<ul><li>Previously, the calculation reserved the coupon for the web store POS terminal. If the shopper left without completing the order, the coupon stayed locked for the rest of the day, and a store POS showed the message that the coupon is reserved by another terminal.</li><li>Now the coupon stays available in stores until an order is actually placed. A coupon that another terminal has reserved is still rejected, and placing the web order, the POS and Self-Checkout reserve coupons as before.</li></ul></li><li><b>Action required by partners:</b>
<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<strong>89291 Mix & Match offer with Coupon condition is not removed when the coupon is voided from the transaction</strong>
<ul><li>Voiding a coupon line in the POS now removes the Mix &amp; Match offer discount from all lines when the coupon condition is no longer met.</li></ul>
<strong>89177 CO Prepayment - post to account</strong>
<ul><li>Customer orders paid with Post to Account now create the right customer claim and output VAT when you post the sales order. Before, the amount was closed against a prepayment invoice, so no claim was created and no VAT was posted.</li><li>When you use prepayment invoices, only the paid share of an order is now prepayment-invoiced. A mixed order, partly paid by cash or card and partly posted to the customer's account, is invoiced for just the paid amount.</li><li><b>Action required by partners:</b>
<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
