<ul><li><b>Qs</b> <b>option was added to Water Quantity UoM</b><ul><li>A <b>Qs</b> option was added to Water Quantity UoM on the prescription order line (and posted line), so pharmacists can record <b>filled to measuring line, unspecified amount</b> instead of forcing a 0 ml entry.</li><li>Selecting Qs clears the quantity value automatically, and entering a real quantity clears Qs back out - the two are mutually exclusive.</li><li><b>Add Water Qty</b> dialog was fixed so a 0 ml quantity paired with Qs no longer triggers the <b>incomplete water data</b> prompt.</li><li>The outbound eResept quality-check message and the PDD read-back mapping both use this same field now.</li></ul></li></ul>
