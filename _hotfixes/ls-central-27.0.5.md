<strong>73637 ADD 3 EVENTS</strong>
<ul><li>New events were added to <b>LSC Item Variants Functions</b> codeunit.</li></ul>
<strong>73491 Voiding POS lines with package activity does not delete the activity (using SellProduct)</strong>
<ul><li>An issue was fixed, related to using the SELLPRODUCT POS command to sell activity package products.
