<strong>90110 Sco Connector - Calc & Post Transaction</strong>
<ul><li>Post self-checkout transactions without recalculating them. If a price changes after the customer has been charged, posting no longer fails with a balance mismatch. It uses the amounts the customer already paid.</li><li><b>Action required by partners:</b>
<ul>
<li>To skip the recalculation when posting, subscribe to the <b>OnBeforeCalculateOnPost</b> event in the SCO Connector and set <b>SkipCalculation to true</b>. Posting then requires a zero balance, within the store's allowed difference in transactions. Discount lines are not returned in the response on this path.</li>
<li>Otherwise, none.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
