## Follow the latest hotfixes

I have put together these RSS feeds to make it easier to keep track of hotfixes for LS Central and related products. If you subscribe, you will get notified whenever a new hotfix is released â€” no need to go searching for updates.

## RSS Feeds

{% assign products = site.hotfixes | map: "product" | uniq %}

<ul>
    <li>
        <a class="btn btn-rss" href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/feed/all.xml" target="_blank">Subscribe to all RSS</a>
    </li>
    <br>
{% for product in products %}
    {% assign fixes = site.hotfixes | where: "product", product %}
    {% assign fix = fixes | first %}
        <li>
            <a class="btn btn-rss" href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/feed/{{ product | downcase | replace: ' ', '-'}}.xml" target="_blank">Subscribe to {{ product }} RSS</a>
        </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
